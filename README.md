# Manager README
Hey there... If you're reading this probably worked/work/will-work together or you just want to copy my readme... in any case, I'm happy to have you here.
I'm here to learn, to add value, and enjoy the ride. I'm not a visionary and probably you're smarter than me... letâ€™s start.

Feel free to ping me in [twitter](https://twitter.com/matiasburni) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiasburni/?locale=en_US).

## About Me
I'm Matias, I'm from Argentina, I'm married and I have 2 kids, I live in Barcelona (Spain), I'm a software engineer (more console than dev, build/release engineer or devops kind). I like [padel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGUOHfNaoco&ab_channel=WorldPadelTour) and mountain bike... ex frustrated [squash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTcvGK3k1IQ&ab_channel=PSASQUASHTV) player (lol). I speak Spanish/English/French and I'm learning Catalan. I'm not an english native speaker, so please be patient, corrections are accepted (this is how I grow). I'm an extrovert, but lately, with age, in my personal life, I became more selective with people.

## My Values & Principles
**Default to action**... I always find something to do, my TODO list is endless as my willingness. 
A downside is that in some cases I start acting before thinking, even before identifying the issue that I'm trying to solve, which leads to iterate more than desired. I'm aware of this and I always loop my ideas/solutions with people around, feedback is a blessing.

**Good vibes**
I don't want to work in a rigid environment, I want to have space to say what I think and add value to topics. And with time I've learned that having good energy and being empathetic is a MUST for me, it's my way to promote a safe/cool environment. 

**Relentless**
I'm direct, with respect/carefulness but direct. If I see something and I consider that my feedback can help, I'll share it even if it's uncomfortable. I'm also relentless with myself, I constantly embrace feedback and try to improve my behavior/profile.

**Here to help**
I will help you if you ask or if I detect that I can add value to your proposal. I'm self-organized and I'll always find time for others. I'm a strong believer that software is the result of social interaction (ex: PR reviews), and participating from different angles in that construction is key for achieving great results.

**People first**
I like people. I like technology. Being an engineer manager combines both. We're complex systems, with commonalities and differences, in constant evolution... reading what's around me is a challenge, people are my main challenge... projects come and go (don't misread this, I believe in excellence).
Side note... I consider that in the software industry we're a bit spoiled and that in some cases we lose contact with reality, I try to be honest with my reality and transmit that to people.

## Strengths
* Hard worker. I will always try, over and over.
* Create bonds across teams/organizations. I like connecting people and connecting to people. 
* Customer-oriented. I want to understand deeply what you need.

## Weaknesses
* In some cases I provide too much context before going to the point
* Recognition. Normally I put people achievements over mine, to the point that I rarely take credit for my achievements
* Clarity sharing strategies orally. Speaking I could look messy even if my proposal is clear in my brain. I tend to write a lot because this process helps me to organize the pitch. (if you see long agendas, don't worry is more a script than something for you).
  * In some cases being a non-English speaker doesn't help here.
* I use too much "I don't know" when in fact I know
* English.

## Our Average Week
We will have a  1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes. These meetings are for you first, and me second.
* We both can add topics to the agenda, you have priority
* These are not status meetings unless you want them to be. I prefer offline status reports.
* Do not wait if you have something urgent. Slack me immediately, and we will get on a video call.

## Communication
In order of preference:
* face to face
* face to face in zoom
* Slack
* other

Probably we're in different time zones, so my answer won't be instant in Slack or emails.

## My assumptions
* You have good intentions
* You're here to help and learn
* You will ask if something is not clear
* You won't monopolize a discussion
* You understand that we have roles to add value from different perspectives

## My calendar
Public and available, and my business hours too. 
Feel free to set up a 1:1 or to invite me to a meeting, if I can't I'll say "no" or reschedule.
I'm in Europe and for most of my career, I worked with different time zones, mostly us-west, which means a 9hs shift. I learned to work in this environment (async, write, be clear, give context, consistent, etc)... but in some cases meetings are necessary.

**Wednesday I work until 12:00 Pacific time (PST), please use my time wisely**

## Feeback
I like receiving it in any form, at any time.

I like giving it, and it's also part of my role. Always assume best intentions from me, giving feedback is hard and it takes time, if I do it is because I care about you.

Please be timely with feedback because I'll try to take action asap or enjoy it asap. :)
